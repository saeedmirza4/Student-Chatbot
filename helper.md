You are assisting me in building my first ever AI chatbot project. Please keep in mind that I am a complete beginner — I have never built a chatbot before, I do not know how the pieces fit together, and I need step-by-step guidance. Assume that I know very little about programming and chatbot development, so explanations must be clear, beginner-friendly, and not overly technical.

The project we are building is an AI-powered chatbot for students. Its purpose is to act as a Student Helper Chatbot. The chatbot should:

Answer common student-related questions in a simple and clear way (like “What is GPA?”, “How to calculate CGPA?”, “What is today’s timetable?”).

Be able to calculate GPA or CGPA when the student provides their subjects and grades.

Allow students to set reminders (like “Remind me about tomorrow’s class at 9am”) and then respond back with those reminders.

Have natural conversations and explain concepts (e.g., if a student asks “Explain binary search” the chatbot should give an easy explanation).

Be designed to feel friendly, helpful, and approachable for students.

This is not just a static script chatbot. It should have AI capabilities so that it can respond naturally to different kinds of student queries, not only fixed questions.

As we build this together, I need you to:

Break tasks into small, understandable steps.

Explain the reasoning behind the code or setup so that I learn as we go.

Offer beginner-friendly explanations of new concepts (like what an API is, what a function does, what a server is, etc.).

can be used as:

a simple chatbot that can answer a few fixed FAQs.

an AI so it can handle natural conversations.

also add extra features like GPA calculator, reminders, or storing information.

Show me what u are doing how u writing the code in what lang and all, how to structure it, and how to run it.

Guide me in testing and improving the chatbot step by step.

Do not assume I already know what I am doing. Treat this as my first ever coding project, so please also provide context, comments, and beginner-friendly explanations alongside the code.

Your role is to guide me along the way like a mentor while also generating the code I need.
